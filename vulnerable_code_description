Certainly! Hereâ€™s an example of vulnerable PHP code that demonstrates a common security issue: SQL injection. Keep in mind that this code is intentionally insecure for educational purposes, and you should never use it in a production environment. In this example:
1.	The user input ($username) is directly interpolated into the SQL query, making it susceptible to SQL injection.
2.	A malicious user could input something like ' OR '1'='1 as the username, which would result in all user records being returned.
