1.	Sanitize User Input:
o	Use mysqli_real_escape_string() or prepared statements to sanitize user input before using it in queries.
o	For example, replace $username with mysqli_real_escape_string($db, $username).
2.	Avoid Displaying Sensitive Information:
o	In a production environment, avoid displaying raw user data directly. Instead, use proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
Remember that security is crucial, especially when handling user input and database queries. Always follow best practices to prevent vulnerabilities like SQL injection.
